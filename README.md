how to run: 
    1. Download the compressed folder into your directory 
    2. Uncompress it in the same directory

    5. Type "ruby Game.rb" into your terminal window
    6. Follow the game's instructions as presented in the terminal window

limitations:
    Does not prevent player 1 from moving player 2's pieces (just like
    a physical board game would not).

    You cannot view the menu during a game of Fanrona, you can only do this
        before a game has started.
